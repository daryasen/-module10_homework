This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/[name].tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

##Why use Create Next App?
create-next-app allows you to create a new Next.js app within seconds. It is officially maintained by the creators of Next.js, and includes a number of benefits:

Interactive Experience: Running npx create-next-app@latest (with no arguments) launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project.
Zero Dependencies: Initializing a project is as quick as one second. Create Next App has zero dependencies.
Offline Support: Create Next App will automatically detect if you're offline and bootstrap your project using your local package cache.
Support for Examples: Create Next App can bootstrap your application using an example from the Next.js examples collection (e.g. npx create-next-app --example api-routes).
Tested: The package is part of the Next.js monorepo and tested using the same integration test suite as Next.js itself, ensuring it works as expected with every release.
